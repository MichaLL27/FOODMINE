To run a backup, you need `MONGO DB database`

1. Find your ".env" file and open it.
2. Add a new line at the end of the file just like `MONGO_URI`.
3. Type `JWT_SECRET=SOME_RANDOM_TEXT`
4. That `SOME_RANDOM_TEXT` could be any text, and it will be your `jwt secret code`
5. Save the changes you have made to the `".env"` file.
6. Restart your Angular project from the terminal by stopping and then starting it again.
